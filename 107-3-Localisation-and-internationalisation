107.3 Localisation and internationalisation
####################################################################
Candidates should be able to localise a system in a different language than English. As well, an understanding of why LANG=C is useful when scripting.

Key Knowledge Areas

    & Configure locale settings and environment variables.
    & Configure timezone settings and environment variables.

################################
timezone
################################
On linux systems you can use date and cal commands to check the date and the calendar. It is possible to print a custom date using + formatter:

    [mojtaba@funlife ~]$ date +'%Y%m%d-%M'
    20160103-39
    [mojtaba@funlife ~]$ date +'%Y%m%d-%H%M'
    20160103-2239

Timezone determines what is your time difference comparing with a reference timezone. This way you can talk about times regardless from your location. In another words, I can tell you "start the change request at 02:30 UTC" we both know when the change will be started in our own timezone (mine is 02:30 minus 3:30).

You can configure your timezone while installing the system or by using a GUI in the system settings. It is even possible to set the timezone by clicking or right-clicking on the date and time on your panel. But as always there is a command line way. The old one used to be tzconfig but it is not used anymore.

Different distros do have their own configuration commands, a general one is:

    tzselect 
    Please identify a location so that time zone rules can be set correctly.
    Please select a continent, ocean, "coord", or "TZ".
     1) Africa
     2) Americas
     3) Antarctica
     4) Arctic Ocean
     5) Asia
     6) Atlantic Ocean
     7) Australia
     8) Europe
     9) Indian Ocean
    10) Pacific Ocean
    11) coord - I want to use geographical coordinates.
    12) TZ - I want to specify the time zone using the Posix TZ format.

This process will suggest you to set a variable called TZ as follow to set your own time zone, but not the systems:

    TZ='Asia/Tehran'; export TZ

################################
Configuring timezone
################################
There is a directory at /usr/share/zoneinfo/ containing all the timezone info. These are binary files. If you need to change your systems timezone you need to change 2 files:

    cat /etc/timezone 
    Asia/Tehran

and there is a short link at this place:

    # ls -ltrh /etc/localtime 
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1.7K Jan  2 18:10 /etc/localtime

This file should be replaced by the correct file from /usr/share/zoneinfo/. It is nicer to make a symbolic link rather than copying the actual file. This will prevent the conflicts during next upgrades.

################################
Configuring Languages
################################
You can check the status of current selected system language by issuing locale:

    $locale
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    LANGUAGE=
    LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_ALL=

These are all environment variables telling system what languages to use. Here I'm using LANG=en_US.UTF-8 which means I'm using English with US variant and UTF-8 encoding.

UTF-8 and other encodings will be discussed a bit later in this chapter

Other variables tell the system how to show different things based on localisation systems. For example if we change the LC_TIME to "en_GB.UTF-8" the time will be printed in Great Britain format from that moment on.
Another important settings is LC_ALL. It can be used to change ALL settings. If you do a export LC_ALL=fa_IR.UTF-8, all the settings will be set to that one, with no exception. It is always possible to unset LC_ALL.

################################
LANG=C
################################
Another important point to know is the LANG=C settings. This indicates two things:

    1-All language settings will be default (en.US)
    2-Binary sort order

It is also possible to do a LC_ALL=C.

################################
changing or adding locales
################################
This is not a part of LPIC exam but it is good to know that on a debian based machine, you can change, add or set your default locales using dpkg-reconfigure locales.

################################
Character Encoding
################################

################################
ACSII
################################
Computers used to work with 7bit characters encoding. That would give us 128 characters which was enough for numbers, punctuation and digits!

################################
ISO-8859
################################
It had more characters and a lots of sets for Thai, Arabic and other languages but still had ASCII character sets.

################################
UTF-8
################################
The Unicode Transformation Format is the newest encoding method. It is a real universal encoding with characters not only for all written languages but also for fun characters like ¾, ♠, π and ⚤. It is backward compatible with the ASCII and uses 8 bit code units (not 8 bit coding!). In most cases it is a good idea to use UTF-8 and be sure that your system will work in practically all cases.

################################
iconv
################################
If you needed to convert coding to each other, the command is iconv. The -l switch will show you all the available codings:

    iconv -f WINDOWS-1258 -t UTF-8 /tmp/myfile.txt

Note: -f is for "from" and -t is for "to". Easy to remember

In 2016 you will seldom need this command but it is a must to know it, specially if you are living in a non US country!
